I have a Garmin Vivoactive 6.


# Garmin Vivoactive 6 – Data Types Collected

## Heart & Autonomic Metrics
- Heart rate (24/7)
- Resting heart rate
- Heart rate variability (HRV) – nightly
- HRV Status (7-day rolling analysis)
- Stress level (all-day)
- Pulse Ox (SpO₂)
- Respiration rate (breaths/min)

## Sleep & Recovery
- Sleep stages (light, deep, REM)
- Sleep duration
- Sleep score
- Naps (auto-detected)
- Sleep movements / restlessness
- Morning report (sleep summary, HRV status, Body Battery, etc.)
- Recovery time estimate
- Sleep need estimate (sleep coach)

## Energy & Quality-of-Life Metrics
- Body Battery (energy estimate from HRV + sleep + stress + activity)
- All-day stress
- All-day activity load
- Readiness-style coaching (Garmin’s recovery insights)

## Activity & Fitness Tracking
- Steps (daily)
- Step goals (adaptive or fixed)
- Distance (GPS or step-estimated)
- Calories burned (active + resting)
- Floors climbed (if supported; Vivoactive 6 **does not include a barometric altimeter**, so this is often absent)
- Intensity minutes
- VO₂ max (estimated)
- Training effect (aerobic/anaerobic) when workouts support it
- Training load (short-term & longer-term)
- Fitness age (derived)

## Sports / Workout Metrics (depends on activity)
- GPS route + pace + speed
- Running metrics (pace, cadence)
- Cycling speed/cadence (with external sensors)
- Heart-rate zones
- Workout duration + HR curves
- HIIT reps / intervals
- Strength training reps (auto-detected)
- Yoga metrics (breathwork + HR changes)
- Other sport profiles (80+ activities)

## Sensor Signals
- Optical HR sensor data
- Accelerometer data
- Gyroscope data
- GPS data (GNSS)
- PulseOx sensor readings
- Ambient light sensor

## Menstrual & Health Tracking
- Menstrual cycle logs
- Pregnancy tracking logs
- Symptom logging (fatigue, cramps, mood, etc.)

## Smartwatch System Data (for completeness)
- Step trends (weekly/monthly)
- HR trends (weekly/monthly)
- HRV trends
- Sleep trends
- Stress trends
- Move alerts (inactivity notifications)
- Battery usage patterns




## What the current evidence supports:

From the papers and docs we looked at (HRV + ME/CFS + Long COVID + wearables + pacing):

Lower HRV ↔ higher fatigue / worse symptoms
Multiple ME/CFS and Long COVID studies show that reduced HRV (esp. lower RMSSD / HF power, higher LF/HF) is associated with higher fatigue and autonomic dysfunction.
→ Using overnight HRV and morning HRV deviation from baseline as a key input to “today’s energy budget” is scientifically defensible.

Resting HR and HRV together track autonomic load
Higher resting HR + lower HRV = “sympathetic dominance” / reduced recovery.
→ A combined index like:

HRV z-score (vs personal baseline)

Resting HR z-score
is reasonable as a core “physiological readiness” signal.

Wearables can detect persistent post-infection changes
Long COVID and post-viral studies using Garmin/other wearables show sustained changes in HR, HRV, sleep, and activity can mark people with ongoing symptoms vs controls.
→ Using multi-day trends, not just single nights, is aligned with the literature.

Pacing guided by heart-related metrics is feasible
The heart-rate-monitor pacing studies in ME/CFS/Long COVID show people can use heart-based signals to stay below symptom-triggering thresholds and reduce PEM frequency.
→ So an app that gives traffic-light-style guidance (green/amber/red day) is consistent with what’s already being tried.

Garmin metrics (Body Battery, sleep score, stress, calories) are physiologically meaningful, even if proprietary
Public info + validation studies (not perfect, but okay) support:

Body Battery ≈ HRV + stress + activity + sleep → “recovery vs load” proxy

Stress score ≈ short-term HRV-derived sympathetic activation

Sleep score ≈ sleep duration + continuity + HR features

Calories / steps ≈ activity load
→ Combining these with HRV/resting HR to estimate “energy availability” is reasonable as a model, as long as you’re honest that Garmin’s exact formulas are black-box.
