then a v1 pipeline like this is reasonable:

Baseline building (per user)
Over 3–4 weeks:

Nightly: HRV (RMSSD/lnRMSSD if available), resting HR

Daily: Body Battery min/max, sleep score, stress minutes, steps, active calories

Optional: user-rated fatigue/PEM 0–10
→ Compute rolling means + SD → z-scores per metric.

Feature engineering
For each morning, build something like:

z_HRV_night, z_RHR_morning

z_SleepScore, z_BodyBatteryMorning

z_StressYesterday, z_ActivityLoadYesterday

Maybe 3-day rolling averages (to capture “load debt”).

Score / rule-based model (phase 1)
Start simple and transparent, e.g.:

readiness_score =
    w1 * (-z_HRV_night) +
    w2 * z_RHR_morning +
    w3 * (-z_SleepScore) +
    w4 * (-z_BodyBatteryMorning) +
    w5 * z_StressYesterday +
    w6 * z_ActivityLoadYesterday


Then map readiness_score → energy zones:

Low score → “green” day (more energy budget)

Medium → “amber”

High → “red” (protective pacing, lower activity cap)

Weights w1..w6 can initially be hand-tuned based on literature (e.g. prioritize HRV, RHR, sleep), then refined per user using their own PEM ratings.

User-specific learning (phase 2)
Once you have n=1 (you), later maybe n>1:

Use logistic/ordinal regression or tree-based models to predict next-day PEM or fatigue from these features.

This remains exploratory but is formal statistics, not vibes.

Communication / UX
Make it very explicit:

“This app is experimental.”

“It uses patterns described in HRV/autonomic/ME/CFS/Long COVID research, but has not been clinically validated.”

“Use this as guidance, not medical advice.”
