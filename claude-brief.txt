I want to design an Android app that can replace, and does a lot more than what the Visible app for MECFS currently does.

/research folder 

create a subfolder /articles

look at urls.txt and download all the full articles as PDF files.
If they are not available on the source link, download them through https://sci-hub.se/

Create more subfolders as needed :

Compile all the research into individual markdown files per category (HRV / Sleep / Resting Heart Rate) specifically as they relate to MECFS. 

Compile all the math and calculation information you find in the articles, specifically for how HRV is calculated, how Garmin might calculate the body battery score etc.


## Goals 

I want to create an Android app that will use all available data from the Garmin Vivoactive (see garmininfo.txt for more info).
It should take averages over a few days, and then also the data for the past 24 hours (which weights heavier), and then give the user a recommendation for if they have a normal day, if they have a good day, if they should take it easy.
Preferably calculate an amount of available energy points, which will drain during the day with everything they do, based on HRV changes / HR changes / stress level changes etc. 
To start we can monitor the data for the past 30 minutes every 30 minutes, or maybe even live? NOt sure what battery drain that will cause.
We can also hand off the data to a webserver to perform the (more complex) calculations and just send a reply back to the app.

## Please make a plan for how you can research the best way to do this, using the information I have already collected for you, as well as possible other information. Also use your existing knowledge of this topic or spin off agents.

I think for Android, kotlin is most often used??
